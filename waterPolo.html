Water Polo	
</font>
</p>

<p align = "left"><font size = "8">
<b>Equipment: </b> <i>water polo swim suit, goal cage, swim cap, water polo cap, sunscreen</i>
<p></p>
<b>Weather:</b> <i>Anything but lightning. Literally, anything.</i>
<p></p>
<b>The Experience</b>
Although the name may mislead one to think that it is played with horses,
Water Polo is a contact-sport that is like hockey, but in the water. Many take up the sport to keep in shape for competitive swimming,
and end up liking water polo better.
<p></p>
Best played when sunny, but doesn't stop one from playing it in the rain, snow, etc. Remember to get out of the water asap when
there is a thunder storm.
